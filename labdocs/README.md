# Designing and Implementing an Azure Data Science Solution

## Course Labs

Welcome to the hands-on lab exercises for course DP-100 *Designing and Implementing an Azure Data Science Solution*. The labs are designed to accompany the course and enable you to practice using the technologies described in the classroom materials.

You should complete the labs in order, following the instructions in each Markdown document carefully. In some labs, you will need to clone this GitHub repo to your own development environment.

> **Note**: The labs require a Microsoft Azure subscription. If your instructor has not provided you with one, you can sign up for a free trial at https://azure.microsoft.com.

> **Important**: Remember to stop any virtual machines used in these labs when you no longer need them - this will minimize the Azure credit incurred for these services. When you have completed all of the labs, consider deleting the resource group you created if you don't plan to experiment with it any further.
