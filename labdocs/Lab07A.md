# Lab 7A: Creating a Real-time Inferencing Service

There's no point in training and registering models if you don't plan to make them available for applications to use. In this lab, you'll deploy a model as a web service for real-time inferencing.

## Before You Start

Before you start this lab, ensure that you have completed [Lab 1A](Lab01A.md) and [Lab 1B](Lab01B.md), which include tasks to create the Azure Machine Learning workspace and other resources used in this lab.

## Task 1: Create a Real-time Inferencing Service

In this task, you'll create a real-time inferencing service as an Azure Container Instance (ACI).

1. In [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://ml.azure.com), view the **Compute** page for your workspace; and on the **Compute Instances** tab, ensure your compute instance is running. If not, start it.
2. When the notebook VM is running, click the **Jupyter** link to open the Jupyter home page in a new browser tab.
3. In the Jupyter home page, in the **DP-100** folder, open the **07A - Creating a Real-time Inferencing Service.ipynb** notebook. Then read the notes in the notebook, running each code cell in turn.
