# Lab 3A: Running Experiments

Experiments are at the core of a data scientist's work. In Azure Machine Learning, an *experiment* is used to run a script or a pipeline, and usually generates outputs and records metrics.

## Before You Start

Before you start this lab, ensure that you have completed [Lab 1A](Lab01A.md) and [Lab 1B](Lab01B.md), which include tasks to create the Azure Machine Learning workspace and other resources used in this lab.

## Task 1: Run Experiments in a Compute Instance

An Azure Machine Learning Compute Instance provides a useful environment for running experiment code, right in your workspace.

1. In [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://ml.azure.com), view the **Compute** page for your workspace; and on the **Compute Instances** tab, ensure your compute instance is running. If not, start it.
2. When the notebook VM is running, click the **Jupyter** link to open the Jupyter home page in a new browser tab.
3. In the Jupyter home page, in the **DP-100** folder, open the **03A - Running Experiments.ipynb** notebook. Then read the notes in the notebook, running each code cell in turn.
