# Lab 5A: Working with Environments

All Python code runs in the context of an environment, which determines the Python packages available. When you run a script as an experiment in Azure Machine Learning, you can configure the environment in which it runs.

## Before You Start

Before you start this lab, ensure that you have completed [Lab 1A](Lab01A.md) and [Lab 1B](Lab01B.md), which include tasks to create the Azure Machine Learning workspace and other resources used in this lab.

## Task 1: Work with Environments

In this task, you'll use code in a notebook to work with environments for Azure Machine Learning experiments.

1. In [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://ml.azure.com), view the **Compute** page for your workspace; and on the **Compute Instances** tab, ensure your compute instance is running. If not, start it.
2. When the compute instance is running, click the **Jupyter** link to open the Jupyter home page in a new browser tab.
3. In the Jupyter home page, in the **DP-100** folder, open the **05A - Working with Environments.ipynb** notebook. Then read the notes in the notebook, running each code cell in turn.

> **Note**: If you intend to continue straight to the [next exercise](Lab05B.md), leave your compute instance running. If you're taking a break, you might want to close all Jupyter tabs and **Stop** your compute instance to avoid incurring unnecessary costs.
