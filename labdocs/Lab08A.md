# Lab 8A: Tuning Hyperparameters

Hyperparameters are variables that affect how a model is trained, but which can't be derived from the training data. Choosing the optimal hyperparameter values for model training can be difficult, and usually involved a great deal of trial and error.

In this lab, you'll use Azure Machine Learning to tune hyperparameters by performing multiple training runs in parallel.

## Before You Start

Before you start this lab, ensure that you have completed [Lab 1A](Lab01A.md) and [Lab 1B](Lab01B.md), which include tasks to create the Azure Machine Learning workspace and other resources used in this lab.

## Task 1: Tune Hyperparameters

In this task, you'll run an experiment to optimize hyperparameters for model training.

1. In [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://ml.azure.com), view the **Compute** page for your workspace; and on the **Compute Instances** tab, ensure your compute instance is running. If not, start it.
2. When the notebook VM is running, click the **Jupyter** link to open the Jupyter home page in a new browser tab.
3. In the Jupyter home page, in the **DP-100** folder, open the **08A - Tuning Hyperparameters.ipynb** notebook. Then read the notes in the notebook, running each code cell in turn.
