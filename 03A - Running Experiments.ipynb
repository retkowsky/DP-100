    "One of the most fundamentals tasks that data scientists need to perform is to create and run experiments that process and analyze data. In this exercise, you'll learn how to use an Azure ML *experiment* to run Python code and record values extracted from data. In this case, you'll use a simple dataset that contains details of patients that have been tested for diabetes. You'll run an experiment to explore the data, extracting statistics, visualizations, and data samples. Most of the code you'll use is fairly generic Python, such as you might run in any data exploration process. However, with the addition of a few lines, the code uses an Azure ML *experiment* to log details of the run."
